## Your First Code Contribution
### For developers
Developers should please help fix bugs or implement features that are on the [Project board](We would appreciate if you can check through our [Project board](https://github.com/steemgigs/steemgigs/projects/1)). If you have a suggestion instead, please don't hesitate to create an issue for it. We will address it.

See [README.md](https://github.com/steemgigs/steemgigs/blob/master/README.md) on how to run the code.

To run the code locally,
- find this code in the head section of index.html: 
`<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="upgrade-insecure-requests">` and comment it out temporarily
- locate src/services/sc2.js and modify like so
```js
import sc2 from 'sc2-sdk'

const sc = sc2.Initialize({
  baseURL: 'https://v2.steemconnect.com',
  // app: 'steemgigs.app',
  app: 'steemgig.app',
  // callbackURL: 'https://steemgigs.org/complete',
  callbackURL: 'http://localhost:8080/complete',
  scope: ['login', 'vote', 'comment', 'comment_delete', 'comment_options', 'custom_json', 'claim_reward_balance']
})

export default sc

```

- Make your changes and commit, it is advisable to make a commit each time you implement a feature.
- before making pusing your commit and making a pull request, do the following
  - test your code and be sure it works
  - ensure your modification and addition does not disrupt an existing feature
  - modify src/services/sc2.js like so
```js
import sc2 from 'sc2-sdk'

const sc = sc2.Initialize({
  baseURL: 'https://v2.steemconnect.com',
  app: 'steemgigs.app',
  // app: 'steemgig.app',
  callbackURL: 'https://steemgigs.org/complete',
  // callbackURL: 'http://localhost:8080/complete',
  scope: ['login', 'vote', 'comment', 'comment_delete', 'comment_options', 'custom_json', 'claim_reward_balance']
})

export default sc

```
  - uncomment
  - find this code in the head section of index.html: 
`<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="upgrade-insecure-requests">` and be sure to uncomment it before you push

>**Note**: Though, the code structure is straight forward and self explanatory but a quick walkthrough of this project's code will soon be added.
