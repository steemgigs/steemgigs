About SteemGigs

Where There Are Talents… Dreams Happen!

We are an open source freelance platform located within the decentralized Steem Blockchain Protocol with a burning desire to help everyone and anyone within the ever growing Steem Community to transform their personal dreams into visible and successful reality.
Because we so much believe in that there is a hidden or innate skill inside every single Steemian or SteamGigger, we aim to collect and maintain a database of reputable and highly talented Steemian freelancers worldwide, in every niche, so we can recommend such persons to others on the Steem Blockchain Community who may be in dire need of their expertise.

Everyone Has Something To Offer
We therefore strive to build a communal haven for the world’s most reputable freelance talents, giving them an open, free and reputable platform to...
•	Showcase their abilities
•	Develop their skills
•	Build business and life-long relationships  with their fellow Steemians and of course,
•	Make good, honest, commission-free and charge-back free money on the side via Steem’s inbuilt cryptocurrency (Steem), as well as other mediums of exchange such as Steem Power and Steem Blockchain Dollars (SBD).

All you need to do enjoy the financial perks, including other personal, self fulfilling benefits just like the rest of our 4800+ members (whether as a buyer or seller) are currently doing right now is to simply create a Steem account via Steemconnect or Steemit.
