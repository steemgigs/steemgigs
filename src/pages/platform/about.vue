                <h4>Other Special Highlights From The Current Steemgigs Version.</h4>
                <h4>Bropro</h4>
                <p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/p/7ohP4GDMGPrUMp8dW6yuJTR9MKNu8P8DCXDU9qmmkb48DVikadsvSRSoN4dr2hNHt4d2BJ2vgLfe9PP9apAHRakWsw3G5CvSSKRB?format=match&amp;mode=fit&amp;width=640" width="640" height="292" /></p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>We have started the framework for a core aspect of SteemGigs called <strong>'BROPRO'. </strong>This page will display <em>certified users</em> who are willing to offer expert consultancy services in exchange for the <a href="https://steem-engine.com/?p=market&amp;t=TEARDROPS"><em>teardrops tokens&nbsp;</em></a></p>
                <p>We hope to use this page to create some utility for the teardrops tokens even now, prior to the inception of the SMT protocol. At this stage, we will populate this page manually. In the future, it will become an exclusive UI perk available
                    to <em>'certified users'</em>. <a href="https://ulogs.org/steemgigs/@surpassinggoogle/have-you-heard-of-steemgigs-org-s-bropro-yet-it-will-be-powered-by-the-teardrops-tokens">Read more...</a></p>
                <h4>A Microtasks Economy</h4>
                <p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/p/C3TZR1g81UNaPs7vzNXHueW5ZM76DSHWEY7onmfLxcK2iP5VP3LTVe4Xji9iZpjgaaW6m8oEJHeWgPiDozhTHyaDYnjCnG3SBckRndb8xkCm1TnoFekFcXp?format=match&amp;mode=fit&amp;width=640" width="640" height="306" /></p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>We also began the framework that will integrate '<em>a microtasks economy'</em> into SteemGigs, starting with a basic <em>'create a microtask'</em> post-editor and a <em>'microtasks display column'</em> on our homepage.</p>
                <p>The microtasks economy especially helps non-experts to <em>'grow in their confidence and hone their skills or talents while transitioning into experts, all while being able to offer a service'</em>. Hirers will also be able to <em>'pay with vote'</em>,
                    which on its own is powerful. <a href="https://ulogs.org/steemgigs/@surpassinggoogle/task-request-kindly-help-us-add-a-microtasks-segment-to-our-homepage-upon-login-and-a-corresponding-microtask-post-editor">Read more...</a></p>
                <h4>A Linkedin-like Economy</h4>
                <p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/p/C3TZR1g81UNaPs7vzNXHueW5ZM76DSHWEY7onmfLxcK2iP4px2C2Qqm6twpWt9GhwjQzLm2dmx8UJAw7eqZEZPvGegdBjUPfkkau4gVQ9AQNkKKLLjjrCEa?format=match&amp;mode=fit&amp;width=640" width="640" height="306" /></p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>We have also began the framework for a <em>'linkedin-like economy'</em>. SteemGigs as an enterprise should be capable of involving<em> 'everyone'</em> organically. A core aspect of our model is<em> 'removing all barriers to entry in relation to dream-building'</em>.
                    Thus, we have started enhancing the SteemGigs search-engine to be able to locate <em>'related user-profiles' </em>to a user's search query, where a user can't find <em>'an exact gig'</em>.</p>
                <p>Besides, another core aspect of our model is <em>'steem growth'</em>. To this effect, we must be able to unveil <em>'the wealth in our steem community of reputable great minds'</em> and organically involve every steemian in the steemgigs.org
                    ecosystem, whether they are active on steemit.com or not. Thus, we are building our search engine mechanism to be capable of scanning the entire steem blockchain for potential talents/un(dis)talents.</p>
                <h4>The Teardrops SMT</h4>
                <p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/p/C3TZR1g81UNaPs7vzNXHueW5ZM76DSHWEY7onmfLxcK2iQWXh5nnB9WJCfUdawdQ9BpNrsTjxdQYSaz9FYSvobpdTcy74psM35AF5RCUrTczTMza9MD7zjp?format=match&amp;mode=fit&amp;width=640" width="640" height="306" /></p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>The <a href="https://steem-engine.com/?p=market&amp;t=TEARDROPS"><em>teardrops tokens </em></a><em>will power the steemgigs.org ecosystem in conjunction with the 'steem currency'. </em>The teardrops token will be an SMT in the future. This
                    means, that among other utilities, it will form a<em> 'token of influence' </em>on steemgigs.org</p>
                <p>We have started integrating the teardrops token into the current version of SteemGigs. This means that even now, you will be able to offer or pay for gigs using the <a href="https://steem-engine.com/?p=market&amp;t=TEARDROPS"><em>teardrops tokens</em></a></p>
                <p>Since we are working on adding the keychain browser extension soon, you will be able to easily transfer the teardrops tokens, when you want to avail of gigs etc&nbsp;</p>
                <p>You can get some 50 teardrops tokens <a href="https://steemit.com/teardrops/@surpassinggoogle/let-s-get-you-your-first-50-teardrops-tokens-an-emblem-of-human-and-breakthrough-token-to-reward-proof-of-tears"><strong>here</strong></a> if you
                    haven't or get some on steem-engine <a href="https://steem-engine.com/?p=market&amp;t=TEARDROPS"><strong>here</strong></a>!</p>
                <h4>Testimonials</h4>
                <p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/p/C3TZR1g81UNaPs7vzNXHueW5ZM76DSHWEY7onmfLxcK2iQbcDZuoy8yRTJp4nankwVCjLXcCFzzsWd6u4MSb9oCH5MaynC8C6uTCgKHBG89w5L4C5FD61Ca?format=match&amp;mode=fit&amp;width=640" width="640" height="296" /></p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>Unlike conventional freelancing service marketplaces, SteemGigs is very content-based. Recall, the 'surpassinggoogle paradigm' mentioned earlier? '<em>On Steemgigs, content is queen'</em>.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>We would seek to serve the search engines incessantly with our testimonials too, in full-blown testimonial posts that will be displayed on a designated column on our homepage.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>See a <a href="https://steemit.com/steemgigs/@kus-knee/the-old-dog-announces-the-gig-is-on">recent example of a Steemgigs testimonial </a>written by @kus-knee. He has availed of <a href="https://steemgigs.org/steemgigs/@airmatti/create-a-sketchy-blue-pencil-drawing">this gig</a>                by @airmatti. <em>(In some cases, @kus-knee may even be able to raise the funds to pay for the gig from the testimonial article as every content created on steemgigs.org appears also on the steem blockchain to a large community of curators)</em></p>
                <p>Where @airmatti decides, he can decide to document his entire <em>'delivery process' </em>using a series of testimonials, maintaining transparency, opening himself to more clients/opportunities and most of all, improving his overall <em>'real reputation'</em>.</p>
                <h4>Upcoming In The Coming Weeks</h4>
                <p>In the near term, we will focus on making sure the <em>current version of steemgigs.org</em> is bug free. Being that steemgigs.org is very content-based, our first focus is to make sure that users can successfully use every post-editor on
                    steemgigs.org <em>(We have some 18 post editors across steemgigs.org)</em></p>
                <p>As we attain a certain 'stable' state, we will look to add some of the following features/functionalities/enhancement:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Enhance the <em>'search by profile'</em> aspect of our search portal.</li>
                    <li>Add a basic BROPRO page.</li>
                    <li>Add the teardrops tokens wallet.</li>
                    <li>Add video tutorials across steemgigs.org</li>
                    <li>Integrate keychain wallet.</li>
                    <li>Enhance URL-preview for social shares.</li>
                    <li>Add steemconnect and keychain 'wallet transfer' capabilities.</li>
                    <li>etc</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Near Term Plans.</h4>
                <p>Still in the <em>near term, </em>we<em> </em>will work on a raising a budget to begin stage-2 of our development, during which we will begin to build core features and functionalities, to open up steemgigs.org to the world as a whole.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>In a coming release, we will begin to add a <em>'sign-up with email' </em>option, to seamlessly onboard a mainstream audience onto the SteemGigs ecosystem, until they get their steem account.</p>
                <p>We will also look to add features like internal messaging, optional escrow, personalized feeds etc. Some of our core features will have to wait till the SMT protocols begins. However, we will continue to integrate the <a href="https://steem-engine.com/?p=market&amp;t=TEARDROPS"><em>teardrops tokens </em></a>into
                    our ecosystem in the near term, so that it begins to be usable. &nbsp;</p>
                <p>As SMT approaches, we will begin to establish a <em>solid team</em> and a respective <em>'team announcement'</em> will follow'.</p>
                <h4>Long Term Plans</h4>
                <p>One thing is for sure, on steemgigs.org we will innovate dynamically and incessantly to make sure we become a <em>'theater for dream-building and a home for every(any)one'.</em> We want to play an active role in historical history as part
                    of every noble dream.</p>
                <p>Note that steemgigs.org is directly linked to two other steem-interfaces under the umbrella of the teardrops SMT ecosystem, namely <em>'https://ulogs.org'</em> and <em>'@macrohard</em>'. Being that the teardrops SMT will power all three interfaces,
                    we will be able to relay a more established <em>'long term plans'</em>, when we have become abreast with the dynamics of the SMT protocol.</p>
                <p>We will look to make an announcement related to our <em>'long term plans'</em> in the coming months. In the meantime, please go through <em>a series of articles</em> <a href="https://steem.tools/allposts/beta.php?username=surpassinggoogle&amp;tags=steemgigs"><strong>here</strong></a>                to gain insight into the concreteness and evolution of our<em> 'grand picture'.</em></p>

                <h4>FootNote&nbsp;</h4>
                <p>The teardrops token will also form a token of influence on each of these three steem-based websites; <em>'https://steemgigs.org'</em>, <em>'https://ulogs.org'</em> and <a href="https://ulogs.org/@macrohard"><em>'</em></a><a href="https://ulogs.org/@macrohard"><em>@macrohard'</em></a>                etc</p>
                <p>Besides, staking the teardrops token for influence on these interfaces, these tokens will have many other uses. We will incessantly and dynamically innovate ways for this to be the case. This will be discussed in details when the <strong>teardrops SMT colorlesspaper</strong>                is published.</p>
                <p>In the coming days, we will publish a mini 'colorless paper' for the teardrops SMT, covering <em>'the now'</em>.</p>
                <p>The teardrops token is also currently on steem-engine but only a small portion of it was issued and on the steem-engine market, to help us gain insight into <em>the 'dynamics of the tokens on an exchange</em>'.&nbsp;</p>
