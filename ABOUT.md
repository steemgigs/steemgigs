<h3>3. Why You Should Choose SteemGigs?</h3>
<blockquote>SteemGigs is built with an integration of the <strong>steem blockchain</strong>, giving it very <strong>powerful advantage</strong> over <strong>conventional "freelance" marketplaces.</strong></blockquote>
<p><strong>The steem blockchain is open-source and decentralized</strong>. It has an in-built currency called <strong>"steem"</strong> and other forms of currency, like <strong>SBD</strong> and <strong>vested Steem (Steem Power)</strong>. It can handle millions of transactions daily, has zero <strong>fees</strong> and is backed by a reputable community. Using this <strong>decentralized steem protocol</strong>, allows <a href="https://steemgigs.org/"><strong>SteemGigs</strong></a> to run conveniently, <strong>"peer-to-peer"</strong>, without the need for third-parties e.g banks, PayPal etc&nbsp;</p>

<h3>4. Why is SteemGigs important?&nbsp;</h3>
<blockquote>To build a dream is hardly ever easy. There may be odds!&nbsp;</blockquote>
<p>These odds may be lack of mentorship, lack of direction, lack of expertise, lack of capital, lack of connections etc&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>Whatever is lacking, we want to passionately offer it.&nbsp;</blockquote>
<p><strong>But, what if you no longer dream?</strong> Many times, that is what is actually<strong> starting to lack</strong>. Yes, because of the incessant thought that <strong>every other thing is lacking</strong>, we halt dreaming altogether or no longer dream limitlessly.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><strong>SteemGigs:</strong> Is an ecosystem where <strong>"everyone has something to offer"</strong>, thus, making <strong>each dream</strong> closer to <strong>"attainable"</strong>.&nbsp;</blockquote>
<p><strong>We passionately look to prove this and more....&nbsp;</strong> &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>We aim to incentivize the process of <strong>"mining the human".</strong>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>We aim to reward even <strong>"attempts at out-of-the-boxness".</strong>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>We aim to reward even the <strong>art of "sifting sense from non-sense".</strong> (Just perhaps, we will be re-sparked into dreaming again).&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Then, we will <strong>aim to reward reputable SteemGiggers</strong>, who put their expertise into testimonial good use, in helping you build your dreams.</li>
</ul>
<p>To remove all barriers, we also added <strong>an </strong><a href="https://steemit.com/steemit/@surpassinggoogle/steemit-s-untalented-is-in-beta-participate-freely-because-every-participant-in-this-contest-will-win-something-no-losers"><strong>untalented paradigm</strong></a> to <strong>SteemGigs,</strong> aiming to prove one thing: <strong>that,</strong> <strong>if we eliminate bum, average, smart; "we are genius".</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>Everyone has something to offer!</blockquote>
